## Welcome to My Portfolio

# I am Abdelfatah Hezema, Computer Science graduate and software engineer.

I have a passion for CS and a huge curiousity to know how things really work, and it drives me to keep learning, exploring and digging deeper down to learn more.

My experience is mostly in Javascript frameworks (React.js/ Vue.js and Node.js) and Frontend developement.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Abdelfatahh/Hezema/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
