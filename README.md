# Welcome to My Portfolio

## I am Abdelfatah Hezema, Computer Science graduate and software engineer.

I have a passion for CS and a huge curiousity to know how things really work, and it drives me to keep learning, exploring and digging deeper to learn more.

My experience is mostly in Javascript frameworks (React.js/ Vue.js and Node.js) and Frontend developement. 

## Projects

The following projects are my graduation project and side projects that I did during my learning journey.

### FileCabinet

FileCabinet: It is a web application that you can create documents on it or add your own documents on it. You can also edit them and delete them. I developed it using (Ruby on Rails) and I used 3 additional gems and they are (haml, devise and simple_form).

### Bookify
Bookify: It is a book recommendation system which me and a friend of mine implemented it on the intern at Bibliotheca Alexandria. I was responsible to implement the front-end part. To develop it I used HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.

### Collectomatic

Collectomatic (Graduation Project): Collectomatic is a web-mobile application. The idea of the project is mainly based on keeping the city clean. The users of the mobile app can submit a claim when they see an overflow of garbage in the streets, then the monitoring app will send the nearest car to the location where the claim come from. I am responsible for the monitoring app and building it using React.js
