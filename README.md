# Welcome to My Portfolio

## I am Abdelfatah Hezema, Computer Science graduate and software engineer.

I have a passion for CS and a huge curiousity to know how things really work, and it drives me to keep learning, exploring and digging deeper to learn more.

My experience is mostly in Javascript frameworks (React.js/ Vue.js and Node.js) and Frontend developement.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Abdelfatahh/Hezema/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
